    <p>As you know, I am an awesome person :). So it is necessary for me to have many skills to stay awesome and as you know I am amazingly awesome at being awesome.
        To support that claim, I have many useful skills listed below which are in my arsenal. (Let me know if I left some of my skills to point out, cuz it is impossible
        remember all the skills I have ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ).

            I am very good at being sarcastic. Sometimes a little too much. It backfires a lot of times. I am sure a few of them already left reading after
            reading the intro of this page, I was way too arrogant in the intro of this page (deliberately). But who cares.........Bing Bong Bing Bong.......

            WOW!! I can make sound from my mouth so cool O_O..... Everyone can make different sounds using their mouth but the difference is, I make it sound good (maybe).
            I actually started Beatboxing to fix the speech defect I had. I used to speak very unclearly. But after starting to beatbox, I think I have improved 
            (atleast people are not pointing it out anymore). I also love it because you don't have to learn any lyrics. You don't need any instruments to make music.
            haha brrrrrrrrrrrrrr........

        <dd>
            I can eat popcorn, listen to Eminem, beatbox to it, surf reddit and study at the same time. That's how I am currently making this website. I am able to focus 
            on multiple things at the same time. I may not be as productive as I would be doing just one task at a time, but I get the job done. And at the end of the day
            that's all the matters. Oops!!...dropped some popcorns on the keyboard.

            One time I made a bet with my friend when I was in 10th grade. It was 'Who can learn more digits of Pi?' And obviously I won with 43 digits. I am also 
             learning Rap-God currently. I rest my case.

        <dd>
            I may not be the best person to talk about this, but my family is, especially my sister. Annoying her gives me a sense of satisfaction and completeness,
            which I miss a lot after going to college. I am still searching a substitute (target) whom I can annoy and he/she/they won't file a police case on me.
